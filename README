Pycross in python!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version of picross can currently:

*load a picross level from an image (easy level editing!)

*Display a grid using pyglet

*Allow you to mark tiles using the right mouse button

*Draw the numbers needed to solve the picross (still needs work).

*Click tiles and, depending on whether they are a solution in the picross,
color them black (mouse detection! tiles! wooh!)

TODO:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Turn Tile class from a class that draws primitive using openGL.
    This was cool at first, but realistically, pyglet deals with textured
    objects a lot more eleganty then I ever could.

* Lines that divide grids by 5s
    Every picross has this.

* Timer (ability to lose)
    If the user hits the wrong tile, dock time to solve the picross

* Grid that positions and resizes itself in a more intelligent way
    Currently the grid just sticks itself 50 pixels away from the bottom-
    righthand corner of the screen. If a grid is particularly complex or large,
    parts will be shown appearing outside of the screen.

* Actual graphics
    Blue background on white grid, red and black tiles, black text. Exciting.

* Menus, Level selection, Music
    Way down the line.
