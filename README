Pycross in python!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version of picross can currently:

*load a picross level from an image (easy level editing!)

*Display a grid using pyglet

*Allow you to mark tiles using the right mouse button

*Draw the numbers needed to solve the picross (still needs work).

*Click tiles and, depending on whether they are a solution in the picross,
color them black (mouse detection! tiles! wooh!)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example output of the level loader (this is Finn from adventure time):
