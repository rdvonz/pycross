Hello there!

This isn't really even close to picross yet. All the activity is currently
in the testing branch, and it's mostly experiments I'm running to figure
out open gl and pyglet. However, with any luck this will blossom into the
greatest picross clone ever!

Well, probably unlikely. But it will be fun either way.
Oh, and if you see any mistakes or better methods of doing what I'm doing,
definitely tell me. This is about learning after all, right?
