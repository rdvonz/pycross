Pycross in python!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Depends on:
* Pyglet (http://pyglet.org/)
* Numpy (http://new.scipy.org/download.html)


This version of picross can currently:

*load a picross level from an image (easy level editing!)

*Display a grid using pyglet

*Get the numbers needed to solve the picross
(It can't, however, display these in a nice graphical way. You can
print it all to the console and try to solve it that way though :D)

*Click tiles and, depending on whether they are a solution in the picross,
color them black (mouse detection! tiles! wooh!)
